            <p>I'm Mathilde Merx, a Machine Learning student, currently learning Web Development. In this website, you can find articles explaining concepts that I've struggled with, and <a href="matildas_recipies/Contents.html">cooking recipies</a> I bet you won't be able to do without once you've tasted them!</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I'll have finished my studies in March 2021. At that point, I'll be doing an internship: this will be the beginning of my long-awaited first job! I'm really eager and excited to begin to work. I'd like to work in a start up: this industry attracts me very much. Indeed, I love learning and I don't fear having to adapt to a fast moving environment. I know in small and young companies, one employee's work matter a lot, and I'd love to make my company thrive alongside an enthiousastic team!</p>
            
            <h3>MSc Finance Analytics, at King's College of London</h3>
            <img class="img-float-left img-circular" src="Images/KCL.png" alt="King's college logo">
            <p class="text-float-right">During this year, I have leaned a lot about time series: how to forecast them with statistics, Machine Learning (ML)... I have realized ML isn't particularely efficient for time series, whereas it can be very good with images. Hence, I had the idea for my dissertation to transform time series into images (recurrence plot, <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/553.pdf" target="_blank">GAF/MTF</a>, wavelet transform) and use them in ML algorithms, to forecast their future values. I'm really impatient to see the results I'll have at the end! I'll post my dissertation in September, so stay tuned if you're interrested ðŸ˜‰</p>

            <h3>Master of engineering, Ecole Centrale de Lille</h3>
            <img class="img-float-left img-circular" src="Images/ECL.png" alt="Centrale Lille logo">
            <p class="text-float-right"> After <em>Classes PrÃ©paratoires</em> (French intensive learning in Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science, undergraduate level), I got received at Ecole Centrale de Lille, an engineering university. I'll graduate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I've learned a lot of the theory and mathematics behind Machine Learning Algorithms! I've also focused on computer science applied to engineering: some robotic as well as Internet of Things.</p>

            <h3> Diverse MOOCs</h3>
            <p class="p-nopadding">I've always liked learning, so I was thrilled when I discovered Coursera, Udemy and all! I believe when working in a start up, you have to be ready to adapt to the various needs of your company. This challenge makes me want to work in a start up, because I want to keep up with numerous new technologies - and maybe, help making them! I'm currently following a (great) <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Web Development</a> online course, this website is my application.

            <p class="text-float-right p-nopadding"> I was an intern at KPMG, in France, for 3 months. As a link between two business units (AS Bank, and Data&Analytics), I had two missions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing an algorithm forecasting monthly invoices for edge fonds. I used statistic technics, and obtained an average accuracy of 94%!</li>
                    <li>Writing an algorithm affecting consultants to missions, based on different criteria (availability, profitability,...). I used a random walk.</li>

It has made me love start ups: there were a lot of things to do, they were having more and more customers, and everyone was doing whatever they could for the company. Everyone was bringing their skills, everyone was equally heard, it has been a great experience for me. My missions were: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a corporate identity - by improving the SEO of their website, making a template of the legal contracts, putting in place team working tools (email adresses, drive, etc)</li>
                <li>Creating a database of clients, notary, lawers,... And teaching the team how to use it</li>

Whenever I want to empty my head and feel proud of myself, I take a one hour long workout class, and that's how to feel great for the night. I still have some energy? Then I finish with a long stretching session! </p>
